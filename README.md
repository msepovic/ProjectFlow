## 🚀 What is ProjectFlow?

ProjectFlow is a passion project I’ve always wanted to build.  
As a Software Engineer who uses project management tools like Jira daily, I always felt like existing tools were either too closed-off or not enjoyable to use.

ProjectFlow aims to be:
- A modern, open project management tool
- Suitable for anyone — from organizing a college project to managing large enterprise work
- Simple, intuitive, and user-friendly

## 🛠 Implementation

The goal is full cross-platform availability.  
To achieve this, the app is built using the **Flutter framework** — chosen for its:

- Excellent cross-platform support (Android, iOS, Web)
- Beautiful UI capabilities
- Great developer experience

Since most modern PM tools are accessed via the web, a complementary **landing page** will be developed using a traditional web framework for better SEO and public reach.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Flutter (web UI + mobile)

**Backend**
- Dart (business logic)
- Supabase (Postgres database + Auth)
